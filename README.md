# Photogrammetry
This is a 15 ECTS project at my university.

## Overview
This project includes various scripts for image processing, contour extraction, and 3D model generation using photogrammetry techniques.

## Files and Directories

- `segment_specimen.py`: Segments and masks the image.
- `largestcontour.py`: Finds the largest contour after masking is done.
- `Contour Extraction and Radii Calculation.py`: Calculates contour extraction and radii.
- `contour_to_3d_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for contour to 3D model conversion.
- `image_processing.py`: Contains image processing functions.
- `multipleimages.py`: Handles multiple images.
- `final_project_version.py`: **[NEW]** Comprehensive final version of the code that includes all functionalities from the individual scripts.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Final Version:**
   - Execute `final_project_version.py` to run the complete process.

2. **Individual Scripts:**
   - You can still run individual scripts for specific tasks if needed.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
