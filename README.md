# Photogrammetry
This is a 15 ECTS project at LKM Institute, FAU Erlangen, focusing on enhancing the accuracy of mechanical parameter identification by incorporating the actual specimen geometry into simulations.

## Overview
This project includes various scripts for image processing, contour extraction, and 3D model generation using photogrammetry techniques.

## Files and Directories

- `segment_specimen.py`: Segments and masks the image.
- `largestcontour.py`: Finds the largest contour after masking is done.
- `Contour Extraction and Radii Calculation.py`: Calculates contour extraction and radii.
- `contour_to_3d_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for contour to 3D model conversion.
- `image_processing.py`: Contains image processing functions.
- `multipleimages.py`: Handles multiple images.
- `photogrammetry_full_pipeline.py`: Comprehensive final version of the code that includes all functionalities from the individual scripts and additional features such as histogram plots and enhanced error visualization.
## How to Use

1. **Run the Final Version:**
   - Execute `photogrammetry_full_pipeline.py` to run the complete process.

2. **Individual Scripts:**
   - You can still run individual scripts for specific tasks if needed.
